# Documentation Guidelines

This document provides best practices and guidelines for organizing, naming, and managing digital assets to ensure consistency and ease of access.

## General Company Guidelines

1. Use a clear directory structure. Organize documents by category or project module:
   - Examples:
     - `hr/`
     - `finance/`
     - `marketing/`
     - `files/`
     - `source/`

2. Use folders for document file types:
   - Examples:
     - `SVG/`
     - `PDF/`
     - `ICON/`
     - `AI/`

3. Follow consistent naming conventions:
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) to separate words (e.g., `file.svg`, `warning.png`).
   - Use `@2x` or `@3x` for high-resolution images.
   - Avoid spaces and special characters in filenames.

4. Generate and store only necessary assets and documentation wherever necessary.

5. Store license agreements alongside assets:
   ```
   files/file.svg 
   files/file.svg.license.md <!-- License information here for that particular file -->
   or
   files/license.md <!-- License information for all files under the directory -->
   ```

6. Asset Maintenance:
   - Regularly review and update assets to ensure they are current and relevant.
   - Archive outdated assets.
   - Delete unused assets.

7. Use version control for assets:
   - Track changes to assets using Git or another version control system.
   - Include meaningful commit messages when updating or adding assets.

8. Document metadata for assets:
   - Include metadata such as author, creation date, and usage rights in a separate file or as part of the asset's properties.

9. Ensure accessibility:
   - Optimize assets for web and mobile use.
   - Provide alternative text for images and icons to ensure accessibility compliance.

10. Backup assets:
    - Regularly back up assets to a secure location to prevent data loss.
